FULL BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT PLAN

1. PROJECT GOAL
   - Build a basic blockchain system to understand its internal mechanics.
   - Implement block creation, mining, and validation logic.
   - Create a simple CLI or web interface for interaction.

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
   - Programming language: Python.
   - Main modules:
       * Block
       * Blockchain
       * Network (optional, for distributed version)
       * Interface (CLI or Flask web app)

3. BLOCK STRUCTURE
   - Fields:
       * index — block number
       * timestamp — block creation time
       * data — transaction or message
       * previous_hash — hash of the previous block
       * hash — current block hash
       * nonce — number used for mining

4. HASHING SYSTEM
   - Use hashlib (SHA-256).
   - Hash formula: hash(index + timestamp + data + previous_hash + nonce).
   - Hash must start with a certain number of zeros (difficulty level).

5. MINING
   - Implement proof-of-work.
   - Increment nonce until hash meets the difficulty requirement.
   - Once mined, add block to the chain.

6. VALIDATION
   - Verify that each block's previous_hash equals the previous block’s hash.
   - Recalculate hash and compare it to stored one.
   - Ensure the chain’s integrity.

7. TRANSACTIONS (optional)
   - Allow user transactions to be recorded in blocks.
   - Store them in memory until the next block is mined.

8. NETWORK (optional)
   - Simulate peer-to-peer blockchain.
   - Use Flask and HTTP requests to synchronize chains between nodes.

9. INTERFACE
   - CLI (command-line interaction) or web app (Flask).
   - Commands:
       * mine_block()
       * show_chain()
       * check_validity()
       * add_transaction()

10. TESTING
    - Unit tests for each class and method.
    - Chain validation test.
    - Mining stress test.

11. DOCUMENTATION
    - Code comments.
    - README.md with setup and usage instructions.

12. DEPLOYMENT
    - Option 1: local app (Python script).
    - Option 2: Flask app (run on localhost:5000).
    - Option 3: Docker container for distribution.

13. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
    - Wallet system with public/private keys.
    - Consensus algorithms (Proof of Stake, etc.).
    - UI with transaction visualization.
    - Integration with real cryptocurrency APIs.
